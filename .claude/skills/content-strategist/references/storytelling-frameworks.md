# Storytelling Frameworks for Digital Content

Proven narrative structures that transform business content into compelling stories.

## StoryBrand SB7 Framework

**Core Principle**: Customer is the Hero. Brand is the Guide.

### The 7 Elements

**1. Character (Customer)**
- Identify ONE clear desire
- What do they want?
- Make it concrete and specific

**2. Problem (Three Levels)**
- **External**: The tangible issue (what they're trying to fix)
- **Internal**: The emotional struggle (how it makes them feel)
- **Philosophical**: Why this shouldn't exist (the injustice)

Critical insight: Customers buy solutions to INTERNAL problems, but brands usually only address external problems.

**3. Guide (Your Brand)**
- Enter with **Empathy**: "We understand how frustrating it is when..."
- Demonstrate **Authority**: Credentials, testimonials, results

**4. Plan**
- Maximum 3-4 steps
- Make the process look achievable
- Step 3 should always be a positive outcome
- Remove perceived complexity

**5. Call to Action**
- **Direct CTA**: Primary action (Buy Now, Schedule Call)
- **Transitional CTA**: For those not ready (Download Guide, Watch Demo)

**6. Failure (Stakes)**
- What happens if they don't act?
- Use sparingly, "like salt in a recipe"
- Name specific consequences briefly
- Move quickly to solution

**7. Success (Transformation)**
- Vivid picture of life after
- Specific, tangible outcomes
- Emotional resolution

### StoryBrand One-Liner Formula

[Character] + [Problem] + [Plan] + [Success]

Example: "We help small business owners who struggle with inconsistent leads implement a simple marketing system that fills their pipeline predictably."

## Andy Raskin's 5-Part Strategic Narrative

Reframes business storytelling around market shifts rather than problems.

### The Structure

**1. Name the Undeniable Shift**
- Not a problem, a CHANGE happening in the world
- Something prospects already sense but haven't named
- Examples: "Subscription Economy" (Zuora), "End of Software" (Salesforce)

**2. Show Winners and Losers**
- Adapting = winning
- Ignoring = extinction
- Create urgency through market reality

**3. Tease the Promised Land**
- The ideal future state
- Emotionally desirable
- Difficult to reach without help

**4. Introduce Features as "Magic Gifts"**
- Product capabilities as stepping stones
- Not feature lists, tools that enable the journey
- Bridge from current state to promised land

**5. Present Evidence**
- Customer success stories
- Data proving you deliver
- Third-party validation

### Key Distinction

"When you cite a problem, prospects get defensive. When you highlight a shift, they open up about how it affects them."

## ABT Micro-Structure

The most versatile framework for any communication. (And, But, Therefore)

### The Formula

**AND**: Setup/agreement establishing context
**BUT**: Problem/conflict creating tension
**THEREFORE**: Resolution calling to action

### Examples

Basic:
"Small businesses want to grow AND they're working harder than ever, BUT their marketing isn't getting results, THEREFORE they need a clearer message strategy."

Service page:
"You've invested in marketing AND built a solid product, BUT leads aren't converting like they should, THEREFORE you need messaging that speaks to what customers actually care about."

Blog intro:
"Content marketing works AND companies are publishing more than ever, BUT most content fails to generate results, THEREFORE we need to rethink our approach to content strategy."

### Why It Works

- Creates narrative tension
- Forces clarity
- Natural story rhythm
- Works at sentence, paragraph, section, and full-page levels

## PAS Framework

Problem → Agitate → Solution (Dan Kennedy called it "the most reliable formula ever invented")

### The Structure

**Problem**: Name the pain clearly
- Use their language
- Be specific
- Create recognition

**Agitate**: Twist the knife
- Explore consequences
- What happens if unsolved?
- Emotional impact

**Solution**: Present your answer
- Bridge from pain to relief
- Your approach as the path
- Clear next step

### Example

**Problem**: "Your website gets traffic, but visitors leave without taking action."

**Agitate**: "Every day, potential customers visit your site, scan for a few seconds, and click away. That's revenue walking out the door. Worse, you're paying for those visits through ads or SEO investment, and getting nothing back."

**Solution**: "Clear, customer-focused messaging changes everything. When visitors immediately see themselves in your copy and understand how you'll help them, they stay, engage, and convert."

## Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

Simple transformation narrative.

### The Structure

**Before**: Paint the painful current state
- What life looks like now
- The struggle, frustration, limitation

**After**: Show the desired future state
- What life could look like
- The relief, success, freedom

**Bridge**: Present your solution as the path
- How you get them from Before to After
- Your approach, product, or service

### Example

**Before**: "You spend hours creating content that gets ignored. Your blog posts gather dust while competitors seem to effortlessly attract attention."

**After**: "Imagine publishing content that actually gets read, shared, and generates leads. Your inbox fills with inquiries. Your brand becomes the go-to resource in your space."

**Bridge**: "The difference isn't writing more, it's writing strategically. Our content framework ensures every piece serves a purpose and resonates with your audience."

## AIDA Framework

Classic attention-to-action progression.

### The Structure

**Attention**: Capture interest immediately
- Strong headline
- Pattern interrupt
- Curiosity hook

**Interest**: Build engagement

- Provide relevant details
- Create "this is for me" moment

**Desire**: Create want
- Benefits over features
- Emotional connection
- Social proof

**Action**: Direct next step
- Clear CTA
- Reduce friction
- Create urgency (when genuine)

### Application by Page Section

- **Hero**: Attention
- **Problem/Solution**: Interest
- **Benefits/Testimonials**: Desire
- **CTA Section**: Action

## The Curiosity Gap

Based on George Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory.

### Five Triggers for Information Gaps

1. **Direct Questions**: Create gaps through asking
2. **Sequences with Unknown Resolutions**: What happens next?
3. **Violated Expectations**: Something unexpected
4. **Information Others Possess**: What do they know?
5. **Formerly Known but Forgotten**: Retrieval curiosity

### Application Techniques

**Headlines**:
- "The Counterintuitive Reason Your Marketing Isn't Working"
- "What Every CEO Should Know About [Topic] (But Most Don't)"

**Content Loops**:
- "Coming up: the one change that doubled our conversion rate..."
- "But first, let me explain why conventional wisdom is wrong..."

**Ethical Application**: Always satisfy the curiosity you create. Unfilled gaps damage trust.

## The Zeigarnik Effect

People remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones.

### Application

**Open Loops**: Create unresolved tension that pulls readers forward
- "We'll cover the solution in a moment, but first..."
- "The third strategy is actually the most powerful, we'll get there."

**Section Transitions**: End sections with forward momentum
- Tease what's coming
- Create question that next section answers

**Use Sparingly**: Too many open loops creates frustration, not engagement.

## Hero's Journey Adaptation (Web Content)

Simplified for short-form digital content.

### The Core Arc

1. **Ordinary World**: Where the reader is now (the struggle)
2. **Call to Adventure**: The opportunity for change
3. **Guide Appears**: Your brand enters with wisdom
4. **The Plan**: Simple path forward
5. **Transformation**: What life looks like after

### Web Application

- Hero section = Ordinary World + Call to Adventure
- Solution section = Guide Appears
- Process section = The Plan
- Success stories = Transformation proof
- CTA = Accepting the call

## Combining Frameworks

Most effective pages blend multiple frameworks:

**Homepage Example**:
- StoryBrand structure overall
- ABT in hero copy
- PAS in problem section
- BAB in transformation section

**Service Page Example**:
- Strategic Narrative for positioning
- PAS for problem/solution sections
- AIDA for flow
- Curiosity gaps in headings

**Blog Article Example**:
- ABT in intro
- Curiosity gap in headline
- Zeigarnik for section transitions
- PAS for conclusion/CTA

The frameworks are tools, not rigid templates. Use elements that serve the specific content and audience.
