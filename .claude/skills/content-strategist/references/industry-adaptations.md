# Industry Adaptations

How to adapt content strategy across different industries, business types, and buyer contexts.

## B2B vs B2C Distinctions

### Core Differences

| Factor | B2B | B2C |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Sales Cycle** | Long (weeks to months), multiple stakeholders | Short, individual decision |
| **Primary Driver** | Logic, ROI, efficiency | Emotion, trends, immediate needs |
| **Decision Process** | Committee-based, requires consensus | Individual or household |
| **Content Tone** | Professional, authoritative, data-driven | Conversational, relatable, entertaining |
| **Proof Priority** | ROI data, case studies, technical specs | Reviews, UGC, social proof |
| **CTA Approach** | Consultation, demo, download | Buy now, add to cart, subscribe |
| **Content Length** | Longer, more detailed | Shorter, scannable, visual |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Lower (career on the line) | Higher (personal purchase) |

### B2B Content Principles

**Address Multiple Personas**
- End user cares about: ease of use, time savings
- Manager cares about: team productivity, implementation
- Executive cares about: ROI, competitive advantage, risk
- Finance cares about: cost, budget alignment, vendor stability

**Build for Longer Journeys**
- Awareness: Educational content, thought leadership
- Consideration: Comparison guides, webinars, demos
- Decision: Case studies, ROI calculators, proposals
- Implementation: Documentation, training, support

**Lead with Logic, Support with Emotion**
- Data and proof upfront
- Emotional benefits secondary ("peace of mind," "confidence")
- Address career risk implicitly
- Make the buyer look good to their organization

### B2C Content Principles

**Lead with Emotion, Support with Logic**
- Emotional connection first
- Features and specs support the feeling
- Social belonging and identity
- Instant gratification messaging

**Speed and Simplicity**
- Shorter decision windows
- Fewer touchpoints
