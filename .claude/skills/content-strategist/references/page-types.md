# Page-Type Specific Best Practices

Detailed structural guidance for each major page type.

## Homepage Architecture

**Optimal Structure:**

1. **Hero Section**
   - Clear headline: what you do + primary benefit (10 words or fewer)
   - Supporting subheadline expanding the promise
   - High-contrast CTA button with action verb
   - Aspirational image showing outcome (not process)

2. **Problem Statement** (3-4 lines)
   - Acknowledge visitor pain in their language
   - Create "they get me" moment
   - Bridge to solution

3. **Social Proof Bar**
   - 4-6 quality client logos
   - User counts or rating summaries
   - Brief trust indicator

4. **Solution Overview**
   - 3 key benefits maximum (not features)
   - Visual icons or imagery
   - Brief supporting text per benefit

5. **Success/Transformation Section**
   - Before/after contrast
   - Specific results achieved
   - Customer quote if available

6. **Testimonial Section**
   - 1-3 featured testimonials
   - Real photos, names, titles
   - Specific results mentioned

7. **CTA Section (Repeated)**
   - Value proposition restated differently
   - Primary CTA repeated
   - Secondary/transitional CTA option

8. **Footer**
   - Contact information
   - Trust signals (certifications, security)
   - Secondary navigation

**Messaging Priority:**
1. Clarity first (what do you do?) - answered in 3 seconds
2. Value second (why should I care?)
3. Proof third (why should I believe you?)
4. Action fourth (what should I do?)

**Common Homepage Problems:**
- Cluttered layouts with competing messages
- Generic value propositions
- Company-focused instead of customer-focused
- Missing social proof above the fold
- Unclear primary CTA
