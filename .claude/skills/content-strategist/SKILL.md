# Content Strategist & Digital Writer

Transform any website page from mediocre to magnetic through systematic audit and strategic rewrite.

## Core Philosophy

Never start writing. Start investigating. The most important question isn't "what should we write?" but "who is this for and what do they need to believe, feel, or do?"

**The Rule of One**: Every effective piece has one reader, one offer, one big idea, one promise.

**The Iron Imperative**: Treat the reader's time as more valuable than your own.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Discovery (Always First)

Before any audit or rewrite, gather essential context. Ask these questions conversationally:

**Business Context**
- What industry/business type is this?
- What are the primary business goals for this page?
- Who are the main competitors?
- What differentiates this business?

**Audience Context**
- Who is the target persona for this page?
- What awareness stage are most visitors in? (Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware)
- What's the typical buying cycle length?
- What questions do prospects commonly ask?

**Page Context**
- What type of page is this? (Homepage, Service, Product, Pillar, Blog, About, Landing)
- What single action should visitors take?
- What's working well currently?
- What feedback exists from customers or sales?

Adapt question depth to task scope. Quick fix = fewer questions. Full rewrite = comprehensive discovery.

### Phase 2: Content Audit

Use the **5-Point Scoring System** for each criterion:
- **5**: Excellent, follows best practices
- **4**: Good, minor issues
- **3**: Average, needs improvement
- **2**: Poor, multiple problems
- **1**: Critical, needs immediate attention

**Six Core Audit Criteria:**

1. **Headline & Hook Effectiveness**
   - Does it pass the 2-second test?
   - Does it promise a specific benefit?
   - Does it speak to the reader's pain?

2. **Value Proposition Clarity**
   - Clear within 5 seconds?
   - Differentiated from competitors?
   - Written for the reader, not the company?

3. **Structure & Scanability**
   - Logical heading hierarchy?
   - Short paragraphs (under 100 words)?
   - Front-loaded keywords in headings?
   - Adequate white space?

4. **Proof & Credibility**
   - Proof-to-claim ratio (ideal: 2:1 or better)?
   - Specific results over vague claims?
   - Social proof present?

5. **Voice & Tone**
   - Consistent with brand?
   - Appropriate for audience?
   - "You" focused vs "We" focused?

6. **CTA Effectiveness**
   - Clear and specific?
   - Value communicated?
   - Friction reduced?

See `references/audit-methodology.md` for detailed scoring rubrics and common problems.

### Phase 3: Diagnosis

After scoring, identify the **Priority Problems**:

**P0 (Critical)**: Fix immediately
- Unclear value proposition
- Missing or weak CTA
- Wrong audience targeting

**P1 (High)**: Fix within current scope
- Weak headlines
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Walls of text

**P2 (Medium)**: Improve as resources allow
- Voice inconsistency
- Missing proof points
- Suboptimal structure

**P3 (Low)**: Polish
- Minor clarity improvements
- Formatting refinements

### Phase 4: Strategic Rewrite

**The "One Job" Framework**: Assign single responsibility to every element.
- Headlines: Stop the scroll, make the promise
- Subheadlines: Expand promise, build curiosity
- Body copy: Deliver on promise with proof
- CTAs: Direct clear action

**Rewrite Process:**

1. **Lead with BLUF** (Bottom Line Up Front)
   - Most important information first
   - Answer "what's in it for me?" immediately

2. **Apply the 3 Essential Techniques**
   - **"You" Technique**: Rewrite every sentence to begin with "you"
   - **Front-Loading**: Important words at the beginning
   - **Specificity**: "Average 48-hour turnaround" beats "We're fast"

3. **Structure for Scanners**
   - F-pattern aware (horizontal top, shorter below, vertical left)
   - 80% of attention is above the fold
   - One idea per paragraph
   - Descriptive headings that work as standalone statements

4. **Apply Page-Type Framework**
   See `references/page-types.md` for specific structures:
   - Homepage: Clarity → Value → Proof → Action
   - Service Page: Problem → Solution → Benefits → Process → CTA
   - Product Page: Benefits → Features → Proof → Objection Handling → CTA
   - Blog/Pillar: Hook → Promise → Delivery → Takeaways → CTA
   - About Page: Customer Hero → Origin Story → Mission → Team → CTA

5. **Integrate Storytelling**
   See `references/storytelling-frameworks.md` for:
   - StoryBrand SB7 (Customer as Hero)
   - ABT Micro-structure (And, But, Therefore)
   - PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)
   - Before-After-Bridge

### Phase 5: Delivery

Present rewrites with clear rationale:

```
## [Section Name]

**Original:**
[Original copy]

**Rewrite:**
[New copy]

**Why:**
[Specific rationale tied to audit findings]
```

Always provide:
1. Summary of key changes and strategic reasoning
2. Side-by-side comparisons for major sections
3. Specific metrics that should improve
4. Suggestions for testing (if applicable)

## Awareness Stage Adaptation

Match copy intensity to awareness level:

| Stage | Copy Approach |
|-------|---------------|
| **Unaware** | Story first, empathy, no product mention |
| **Problem Aware** | Agitate pain, introduce solution category |
| **Solution Aware** | Benefits, differentiation, introduce your approach |
| **Product Aware** | Features, proof, comparisons, objection handling |
| **Most Aware** | Lead with offer, price, guarantee, make it easy |

"The more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the less you need to say."

## Industry Adaptation

See `references/industry-adaptations.md` for specific guidance on:
- B2B vs B2C distinctions
- SaaS content patterns
- Professional services (agencies/consultants)

- Personal brand/speaker sites
