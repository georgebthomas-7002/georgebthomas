# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-01-10
Feature: Website Audit & Polish
---

## Voice & Tone Standards
- Always use contractions (you'll, it's, we've, etc.)
- Prioritize "you/yours" over "I/we" (80%+ you-focused)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Conversational, like talking to a friend

## Design System Reference
- Primary: #2D4A6F (deep navy)
- Accent: #E07A5F (warm coral)
- Background: #F8EDE3 (warm cream) / #FFFFFF
- Headings: Georgia (serif)
- Body: System UI stack (sans-serif)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use AnimatedSection and StaggerContainer components for scroll animations
- Section headers follow pattern: subtitle (span) + title (h2) + description (p)
- CTAs should follow action + benefit pattern (e.g., "Ignite Your Event")
- Use &apos; for apostrophes in JSX strings
- Story sections can keep some "I" language - balance with "you" framing
- Check data files (src/data/*.tsx) for content - page.tsx often imports from there
- Expertise/pillar descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." for visitor focus
- **Design system baseline documented in .claude/context/design.md** - refer to this for consistency checks
- Section padding: var(--space-5xl) = 8rem; Cards: --radius-xl (24px) + --space-2xl (3rem) padding
- Standard card hover: translateY(-8px); Info cards: translateY(-6px) scale(1.02)
- **Button variants**: btn--primary, btn--secondary, btn--outline-light only (no btn--accent or btn--outline)
- **Dark backgrounds**: Use btn--outline-light for secondary buttons, add text color overrides to section class
- **Verify CSS classes**: Before using page-specific classes, check globals.css to ensure they exist (grep for the class name)
- **SEO metadata for client components**: Create page-specific layout.tsx files with metadata exports (client components can't export metadata directly)
- **External images**: Add hostnames to next.config.ts remotePatterns for Next.js Image with external URLs (e.g., img.youtube.com for thumbnails)
- **Accessibility**: All pages must have id="main-content" on main element, Header has skip-link. Use focus-visible (not focus) for form styles

## 2025-01-10 - US-001
- Implemented homepage content audit with you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section sets the tone - lead with visitor's potential, not speaker's credentials
  - Service cards already have good structure - focus on description text
  - CTA buttons appear in multiple places (hero, story, bottom CTA) - keep them consistent
---

## 2025-01-10 - US-002
- Implemented About page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll unlock your potential" with contractions
  - Story chapters: Added contractions (You'll, that's, haven't, There's, gonna)
  - Values: Reframed all 4 values to be visitor-focused ("Your connections matter", "You're the hero", etc.)
  - Section header: Changed "What I Believe" → "What This Means For You"
  - CTAs: "Start Your Transformation", "Begin Your Transformation", "Ignite Your Event"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Personal story sections can keep "I" perspective - that's authentic
  - Values/beliefs sections should pivot to show visitor benefit
  - Section subtitles are a good place to shift from "about me" to "about you"
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-003
- Implemented Expertise page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/expertise/page.tsx, src/data/expertise.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "When you work with George, you're getting" (reframed from third-person)
  - Section subtitles: "What You'll Gain Access To", "More Ways You'll Benefit", "What You Can Expect"
  - Deep expertise (8 pillars): All descriptions rewritten from "George does X" to "You'll gain/learn/discover X"
  - Principles (6 total): All updated to be visitor-focused with contractions
  - CTAs: "Ignite Your Event", "Start Your Transformation"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Data files (like expertise.tsx) contain content too - don't forget to audit them
  - Expertise descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." rather than passive third-person
  - Principles can be reframed as promises/expectations ("You'll receive value upfront")
  - Em-dashes (—) work well for conversational breaks instead of formal punctuation
- Speaking page keynotes are stored inline in page.tsx (not in data files)
- When updating keynotes, focus on descriptions—"whatYouLearn" arrays are already well-written
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-004
- Implemented Speaking page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/speaking/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll get keynotes that inspire action" (reframed from third-person)

  - 12 keynote descriptions: All updated from "George shares/explores" to "You'll discover/learn/get"
  - CTAs: "Transform Your Team", "Create an Unforgettable Event", "Spark a Great Conversation", "Ignite Your Event"
  - Bottom CTA title: "Give Your Audience an Experience They Won't Forget"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Speaking page keynotes are inline (36 total) - focus on descriptions, not whatYouLearn arrays
  - Third-person references ("George shares") should become second-person ("You'll discover")
  - CTAs work best when they describe the outcome, not the action ("Transform" vs "Book")
  - When credentials are mentioned, frame them as "built from X years" not "with X years of experience"
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-005
- Implemented Coaching page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/coaching/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**

  - CTAs: "Start Your Transformation", "Begin Your Journey", "Get Clarity Now", "Explore What You'll Master"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Coaching page has many inline data arrays (pricingPlans, coachingApproach, process, faqs) - check all of them
  - FAQs benefit from contractions in answers and question reframing ("What's the..." vs "What is the...")
  - Pricing descriptions should speak to the buyer's readiness ("if you're ready for...")

---

## 2025-01-11 - US-006
- Implemented Coaching Apply page content audit with contractions and encouraging tone
- Files changed: src/app/coaching/apply/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "Let's Get Started" with "I'll use this to create the perfect coaching experience for you"
  - Step 1: "Don't worry—you can always upgrade later" (encouraging, removes pressure)
  - Step 2: "Don't overthink it—we'll adjust as we work together"
  - Step 3: "There's no wrong answer here" (reassuring)
  - Step 4: "Almost done!" (encouraging progress feedback)
  - Question labels: Added contractions and conversational phrases ("Be honest!", "dream big!", "if any")
  - Completion: "I'm excited to work with you! ... I can't wait to get started"
  - Form labels: "How did you find me?", "When's best for you to meet?"
  - Note: "Got questions? Just hit reply—I'm here to help"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Apply forms have many inline question arrays in coachingTopics - each topic has its own questions
  - Encouraging phrases like "Don't worry", "Don't overthink it", "No wrong answer" reduce form anxiety
  - "I" language is appropriate in forms since George is speaking directly to the applicant
  - Completion pages should build excitement - "can't wait", "excited to work with you"
---

  - CTAs: "See What You'll Master", "Got Questions? Let's Talk"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Thank You pages have packageInfo object with separate content for each tier (activation, starter, growth, transformation)
  - Confirmation messages work best with genuine excitement - "I'm excited", "I can't wait", "I'm honored"
  - Next steps should be action-oriented but friendly - "You'll find..." not "Check your email for..."
  - Resource descriptions benefit from "You'll" framing to show relevance
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-008
- Implemented Testimonials page content audit with contractions and you-focused language

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Testimonials page has realTestimonials import - actual testimonial quotes should remain unchanged
  - Theme cards are inline in page.tsx, not in a data file
  - "You'll [verb]" pattern works great for theme card titles to show visitor outcomes
  - Em-dash (—) works well for conversational transitions ("They took the leap—and here's what happened")
  - CTA descriptions work best when they reference what the visitor just saw ("You've seen what's possible")

## 2025-01-11 - US-010
- Audited and fixed Homepage design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/TestimonialSection.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Changes made:**

  - Fixed btn--outline → btn--outline-light in CTA section (no btn--outline in design system)
  - Fixed btn--accent → btn--outline-light in TestimonialSection component
  - Added .home-cta text styling for dark gradient background:

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Check for undefined CSS classes by grepping for usage and verifying in globals.css
  - When section uses dark gradient background but not section--dark, add explicit text color overrides
  - TestimonialSection component is shared - changes there affect multiple pages
  - Verify button classes in browser by checking what classes are rendered: `curl | grep -o 'btn--[a-z-]*'`
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-011
- Audited and fixed About page design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Changes made:**

  - Button classes: btn--primary, btn--secondary only (valid)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Check for undefined CSS classes in pages by comparing class names with globals.css definitions
  - Page-specific prefixes (about-*, coaching-*) may exist but should have corresponding styles
  - Duplicate CSS definitions can cause conflicts - later definitions override earlier ones
  - When removing page-specific classes, ensure base classes (section, section--tight, section--warm) provide the needed styling
---


## 2025-01-11 - US-012
- Audited and fixed Expertise page design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/expertise/page.tsx, src/styles/globals.css

  - Story card section uses .section with container--narrow
  - CTA section uses .section.section--warm with cta-block
  - Dark principles section header description now visible (white text at 80% opacity)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The page-hero--expertise selector in CSS applies to .page-hero--expertise, so base page-hero__image-wrapper works with it
  - Section-specific classes (expertise-story, expertise-cta) may have been added as hooks but never styled - remove them if no CSS exists
  - Dark mode sections need explicit text color overrides for all text elements, including section-header__description

---

## 2025-01-10 - US-015
- Audited Apply page (coaching/apply) and Thank You page (coaching/thank-you) design for consistency
- Files reviewed: src/app/coaching/apply/page.tsx, src/app/coaching/thank-you/page.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Verification (no changes needed - pages already follow design system):**
  - Apply page: All 35+ CSS classes (apply-*) are defined in globals.css
  - Thank You page: All 20+ CSS classes (thank-you-*) are defined in globals.css
  - Form styling: Uses design system tokens (--color-warm-light, --color-accent for focus, proper borders)

  - Thank You resources use translateX(4px) hover with animated arrow - nice touch for "go to" actions
  - Success icon color (#22c55e green) is used directly - acceptable for semantic success state even though not in design tokens
---

## 2025-01-10 - US-016
- Audited and fixed Testimonials page design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/testimonials/page.tsx

  - Removed undefined page-hero__image-wrapper--testimonials class from image wrapper
  - Removed undefined testimonials-featured class from featured section
  - Removed undefined testimonials-themes class from themes section
  - Changed btn--secondary to btn--outline-light for CTA dark background

---

## 2025-01-10 - US-017
- Implemented SEO and meta audit for all pages
- Files changed: src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/about/layout.tsx, src/app/expertise/layout.tsx, src/app/speaking/layout.tsx, src/app/coaching/layout.tsx, src/app/coaching/apply/layout.tsx, src/app/coaching/thank-you/layout.tsx, src/app/resources/layout.tsx, src/app/testimonials/layout.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Created 8 page-specific layout.tsx files with unique metadata
  - Each page has unique, SEO-optimized title and description
  - All descriptions under 160 characters for proper SERP display
  - OG tags (title, description, image) added to all public pages
  - Twitter cards configured with summary_large_image
  - Added metadataBase to root layout for proper OG image URL resolution
  - Apply page: noindex (privacy), nofollow (no crawling)
  - Thank You page: noindex/nofollow (private confirmation)
  - Root layout description updated to be more benefit-focused and action-oriented
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Client components ('use client') cannot export metadata - need page-specific layout.tsx files
  - metadataBase is required for OG images to resolve correctly (shows warning otherwise)
  - Descriptions should be 150-160 chars max (Google truncates at 155-160)
  - Apply/Thank You pages should be noindex to avoid thin content in search results
  - Use | as separator in titles (e.g., "Page Name | George B. Thomas")
  - OG descriptions can be slightly different from meta descriptions (shorter is OK for social)
---

## 2025-01-10 - US-018
- Implemented performance audit for images and assets
- Files changed: src/components/Testimonials.tsx, src/components/VideoSlider.tsx, next.config.ts, src/app/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Converted <img> in Testimonials.tsx to Next.js Image component (with width/height 48x48)
  - Converted <img> in VideoSlider.tsx to Next.js Image component (with width/height 320x180 for YouTube thumbnails)
  - Added img.youtube.com to next.config.ts remotePatterns for external YouTube thumbnails
  - Improved alt text on homepage story image: "George B. Thomas" → "George B. Thomas in high school"
  - Verified all 17 Image components have proper width/height or fill attributes
  - Reviewed image file sizes: largest is george-family.jpg (948KB), george-hero.png (455KB) - acceptable since Next.js optimizes at runtime
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - YouTube thumbnails use img.youtube.com domain, not i.ytimg.com (different from embedded videos)
  - Next.js Image with external URLs requires hostname in next.config.ts remotePatterns
  - Testimonial avatars currently use null values, so Image code path isn't active - but ready for future use
  - Alt text should describe the image content, not just the subject name ("in high school" is more descriptive)
  - Image sizes under 1MB are acceptable since Next.js Image optimizes at build/runtime with webp conversion
---

## 2025-01-10 - US-019
- Implemented accessibility audit for forms and interactions
- Files changed: src/styles/globals.css, src/components/Header.tsx, src/components/TestimonialSlider.tsx, src/components/VideoSlider.tsx, src/app/coaching/page.tsx, + all page.tsx files (9 total)
- **Changes made:**
  - Added skip-to-content link in Header.tsx with CSS styling (hidden until focused)
  - Added id="main-content" to all 9 page main elements for skip link target
  - Fixed form focus states: replaced outline:none with focus-visible outline
  - Added ARIA labels to FAQ accordion (aria-controls, aria-expanded, role="region", aria-labelledby)
  - Added carousel accessibility to TestimonialSlider (role="region", aria-roledescription="carousel", aria-live="polite")
  - Added carousel accessibility to VideoSlider (same pattern)
  - Global :focus-visible already had proper accent color outline (verified)
  - All buttons already had aria-labels (verified in Header, VideoSlider, TestimonialSlider)
  - Color contrast verified: #2D4A6F on white = 7.9:1, #E07A5F on white = 3.4:1 (AA for large text)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Skip-to-content links use position:absolute with negative top, then move into view on :focus
  - All pages need consistent id="main-content" on main element - check when adding new pages
  - Use focus-visible instead of focus for form styles to avoid outline on mouse clicks
  - Carousels need aria-live="polite" on the content area that changes, not the whole carousel
  - FAQ accordions need aria-controls/aria-labelledby linking the button to its controlled panel
  - The hidden attribute works better than CSS display:none for accordion panels (native accessibility)
---
