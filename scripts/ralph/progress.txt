# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2025-01-10
Feature: Website Audit & Polish

## Voice & Tone Standards
- Always use contractions (you'll, it's, we've, etc.)
- Prioritize "you/yours" over "I/we" (80%+ you-focused)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Conversational, like talking to a friend

## Design System Reference
- Primary: #2D4A6F (deep navy)
- Accent: #E07A5F (warm coral)
- Background: #F8EDE3 (warm cream) / #FFFFFF
- Headings: Georgia (serif)
- Body: System UI stack (sans-serif)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use AnimatedSection and StaggerContainer components for scroll animations
- Section headers follow pattern: subtitle (span) + title (h2) + description (p)
- CTAs should follow action + benefit pattern (e.g., "Ignite Your Event")
- Use &apos; for apostrophes in JSX strings
- Story sections can keep some "I" language - balance with "you" framing
- Check data files (src/data/*.tsx) for content - page.tsx often imports from there
- Expertise/pillar descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." for visitor focus

## 2025-01-10 - US-001
- Implemented homepage content audit with you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section sets the tone - lead with visitor's potential, not speaker's credentials
  - Service cards already have good structure - focus on description text
  - CTA buttons appear in multiple places (hero, story, bottom CTA) - keep them consistent

## 2025-01-10 - US-002
- Implemented About page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll unlock your potential" with contractions
  - Story chapters: Added contractions (You'll, that's, haven't, There's, gonna)
  - Values: Reframed all 4 values to be visitor-focused ("Your connections matter", "You're the hero", etc.)
  - Section header: Changed "What I Believe" → "What This Means For You"
  - CTAs: "Start Your Transformation", "Begin Your Transformation", "Ignite Your Event"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Personal story sections can keep "I" perspective - that's authentic
  - Values/beliefs sections should pivot to show visitor benefit
  - Section subtitles are a good place to shift from "about me" to "about you"

## 2025-01-11 - US-003
- Implemented Expertise page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/expertise/page.tsx, src/data/expertise.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "When you work with George, you're getting" (reframed from third-person)
  - Section subtitles: "What You'll Gain Access To", "More Ways You'll Benefit", "What You Can Expect"
  - Deep expertise (8 pillars): All descriptions rewritten from "George does X" to "You'll gain/learn/discover X"
  - Principles (6 total): All updated to be visitor-focused with contractions
  - CTAs: "Ignite Your Event", "Start Your Transformation"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Data files (like expertise.tsx) contain content too - don't forget to audit them
  - Expertise descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." rather than passive third-person
  - Principles can be reframed as promises/expectations ("You'll receive value upfront")
  - Em-dashes (—) work well for conversational breaks instead of formal punctuation
- Speaking page keynotes are stored inline in page.tsx (not in data files)
- When updating keynotes, focus on descriptions—"whatYouLearn" arrays are already well-written

## 2025-01-11 - US-004
- Implemented Speaking page content audit with contractions and you-focused language

  - Third-person references ("George shares") should become second-person ("You'll discover")
  - CTAs work best when they describe the outcome, not the action ("Transform" vs "Book")
  - When credentials are mentioned, frame them as "built from X years" not "with X years of experience"

  - Completion pages should build excitement - "can't wait", "excited to work with you"
