Feature: Website Audit & Polish

## Voice & Tone Standards
- Always use contractions (you'll, it's, we've, etc.)
- Prioritize "you/yours" over "I/we" (80%+ you-focused)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Conversational, like talking to a friend

## Design System Reference
- Primary: #2D4A6F (deep navy)
- Accent: #E07A5F (warm coral)
- Background: #F8EDE3 (warm cream) / #FFFFFF
- Headings: Georgia (serif)
- Body: System UI stack (sans-serif)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use AnimatedSection and StaggerContainer components for scroll animations
- Section headers follow pattern: subtitle (span) + title (h2) + description (p)
- CTAs should follow action + benefit pattern (e.g., "Ignite Your Event")
- Use &apos; for apostrophes in JSX strings
- Story sections can keep some "I" language - balance with "you" framing

## 2025-01-10 - US-001
- Implemented homepage content audit with you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section sets the tone - lead with visitor's potential, not speaker's credentials
  - Service cards already have good structure - focus on description text
  - CTA buttons appear in multiple places (hero, story, bottom CTA) - keep them consistent

## 2025-01-10 - US-002
- Implemented About page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll unlock your potential" with contractions
  - Story chapters: Added contractions (You'll, that's, haven't, There's, gonna)
  - Values: Reframed all 4 values to be visitor-focused ("Your connections matter", "You're the hero", etc.)
  - Section header: Changed "What I Believe" → "What This Means For You"
  - CTAs: "Start Your Transformation", "Begin Your Transformation", "Ignite Your Event"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Personal story sections can keep "I" perspective - that's authentic
  - Values/beliefs sections should pivot to show visitor benefit
  - Section subtitles are a good place to shift from "about me" to "about you"
