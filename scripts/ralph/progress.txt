# Ralph Progress Log

Feature: Website Audit & Polish

## Voice & Tone Standards
- Always use contractions (you'll, it's, we've, etc.)
- Prioritize "you/yours" over "I/we" (80%+ you-focused)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Conversational, like talking to a friend

## Design System Reference
- Primary: #2D4A6F (deep navy)
- Accent: #E07A5F (warm coral)
- Background: #F8EDE3 (warm cream) / #FFFFFF
- Headings: Georgia (serif)
- Body: System UI stack (sans-serif)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use AnimatedSection and StaggerContainer components for scroll animations
- Section headers follow pattern: subtitle (span) + title (h2) + description (p)
- CTAs should follow action + benefit pattern (e.g., "Ignite Your Event")
- Use &apos; for apostrophes in JSX strings
- Story sections can keep some "I" language - balance with "you" framing
- Check data files (src/data/*.tsx) for content - page.tsx often imports from there
- Expertise/pillar descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." for visitor focus
- **Design system baseline documented in .claude/context/design.md** - refer to this for consistency checks
- Section padding: var(--space-5xl) = 8rem; Cards: --radius-xl (24px) + --space-2xl (3rem) padding
- Standard card hover: translateY(-8px); Info cards: translateY(-6px) scale(1.02)
- **Button variants**: btn--primary, btn--secondary, btn--outline-light only (no btn--accent or btn--outline)
- **Dark backgrounds**: Use btn--outline-light for secondary buttons, add text color overrides to section class
- **Verify CSS classes**: Before using page-specific classes, check globals.css to ensure they exist (grep for the class name)

## 2025-01-10 - US-001
- Implemented homepage content audit with you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hero section sets the tone - lead with visitor's potential, not speaker's credentials
  - Service cards already have good structure - focus on description text
  - CTA buttons appear in multiple places (hero, story, bottom CTA) - keep them consistent
---

## 2025-01-10 - US-002
- Implemented About page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll unlock your potential" with contractions
  - Story chapters: Added contractions (You'll, that's, haven't, There's, gonna)
  - Values: Reframed all 4 values to be visitor-focused ("Your connections matter", "You're the hero", etc.)
  - Section header: Changed "What I Believe" → "What This Means For You"
  - CTAs: "Start Your Transformation", "Begin Your Transformation", "Ignite Your Event"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Personal story sections can keep "I" perspective - that's authentic
  - Values/beliefs sections should pivot to show visitor benefit
  - Section subtitles are a good place to shift from "about me" to "about you"
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-003
- Implemented Expertise page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/expertise/page.tsx, src/data/expertise.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "When you work with George, you're getting" (reframed from third-person)
  - Section subtitles: "What You'll Gain Access To", "More Ways You'll Benefit", "What You Can Expect"
  - Deep expertise (8 pillars): All descriptions rewritten from "George does X" to "You'll gain/learn/discover X"
  - Principles (6 total): All updated to be visitor-focused with contractions
  - CTAs: "Ignite Your Event", "Start Your Transformation"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Data files (like expertise.tsx) contain content too - don't forget to audit them
  - Expertise descriptions work best as "You'll [verb]..." rather than passive third-person
  - Principles can be reframed as promises/expectations ("You'll receive value upfront")
  - Em-dashes (—) work well for conversational breaks instead of formal punctuation
- Speaking page keynotes are stored inline in page.tsx (not in data files)
- When updating keynotes, focus on descriptions—"whatYouLearn" arrays are already well-written
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-004
- Implemented Speaking page content audit with contractions and you-focused language
- Files changed: src/app/speaking/page.tsx
- **Changes made:**
  - Hero: "you'll get keynotes that inspire action" (reframed from third-person)

  - 12 keynote descriptions: All updated from "George shares/explores" to "You'll discover/learn/get"
  - CTAs: "Transform Your Team", "Create an Unforgettable Event", "Spark a Great Conversation", "Ignite Your Event"

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Speaking page keynotes are inline (36 total) - focus on descriptions, not whatYouLearn arrays
  - Third-person references ("George shares") should become second-person ("You'll discover")
  - CTAs work best when they describe the outcome, not the action ("Transform" vs "Book")
  - When credentials are mentioned, frame them as "built from X years" not "with X years of experience"

- Implemented Coaching Apply page content audit with contractions and encouraging tone
- Files changed: src/app/coaching/apply/page.tsx

  - Form labels: "How did you find me?", "When's best for you to meet?"
  - Note: "Got questions? Just hit reply—I'm here to help"
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Apply forms have many inline question arrays in coachingTopics - each topic has its own questions
  - Encouraging phrases like "Don't worry", "Don't overthink it", "No wrong answer" reduce form anxiety
  - "I" language is appropriate in forms since George is speaking directly to the applicant
  - Completion pages should build excitement - "can't wait", "excited to work with you"

  - Confirmation messages work best with genuine excitement - "I'm excited", "I can't wait", "I'm honored"
  - Next steps should be action-oriented but friendly - "You'll find..." not "Check your email for..."
  - Resource descriptions benefit from "You'll" framing to show relevance

- Implemented Testimonials page content audit with contractions and you-focused language

## 2025-01-11 - US-010
- Audited and fixed Homepage design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/TestimonialSection.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Changes made:**
  - Fixed btn--accent → btn--primary in Expertise Preview section (no btn--accent in design system)
  - Fixed btn--outline → btn--outline-light in CTA section (no btn--outline in design system)
  - Fixed btn--accent → btn--outline-light in TestimonialSection component
  - Added .home-cta text styling for dark gradient background:
    - White headings (h1-h4)
    - 80% opacity white description text
    - White secondary button with hover to white background
- **Verification:**

  - Color usage: All colors from design system tokens
  - Button classes: Now all valid (primary, secondary, outline-light only)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Check for undefined CSS classes by grepping for usage and verifying in globals.css
  - When section uses dark gradient background but not section--dark, add explicit text color overrides
  - TestimonialSection component is shared - changes there affect multiple pages
  - Verify button classes in browser by checking what classes are rendered: `curl | grep -o 'btn--[a-z-]*'`
---

## 2025-01-11 - US-011
- Audited and fixed About page design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/about/page.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Changes made:**
  - Removed duplicate .page-hero--compact CSS definition (kept one with concrete values, removed one with undefined --header-height)
  - Removed undefined page-hero--about class from hero section
  - Removed undefined page-hero__image-wrapper--about class from image wrapper
  - Removed undefined about-stats class from stats section
  - Removed undefined about-story class from story section
  - Removed undefined about-values class from values section
  - Removed undefined about-cta class from CTA section
- **Verification:**
  - Build passes successfully
  - All rendered classes are valid design system classes
  - Timeline cards use --radius-lg, --shadow-sm, translateX(4px) hover (correct)
  - Value cards use --radius-lg, --shadow-sm, translateY(-4px) hover (correct)
  - Button classes: btn--primary, btn--secondary only (valid)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Check for undefined CSS classes in pages by comparing class names with globals.css definitions
  - Page-specific prefixes (about-*, coaching-*) may exist but should have corresponding styles
  - Duplicate CSS definitions can cause conflicts - later definitions override earlier ones
  - When removing page-specific classes, ensure base classes (section, section--tight, section--warm) provide the needed styling

## 2025-01-11 - US-012
- Audited and fixed Expertise page design for consistency with design system
- Files changed: src/app/expertise/page.tsx, src/styles/globals.css
- **Changes made:**
  - Removed undefined page-hero__image-wrapper--expertise class (uses base page-hero__image-wrapper class)
  - Removed undefined expertise-story class from story section
  - Removed undefined expertise-cta class from CTA section
  - Added .section--dark .section-header__description styling for dark mode (rgba(255,255,255,0.8))
- **Verification:**
  - Build passes successfully
  - Hero section renders correctly with base page-hero classes
  - Story card section uses .section with container--narrow
  - CTA section uses .section.section--warm with cta-block
  - Dark principles section header description now visible (white text at 80% opacity)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The page-hero--expertise selector in CSS applies to .page-hero--expertise, so base page-hero__image-wrapper works with it
  - Section-specific classes (expertise-story, expertise-cta) may have been added as hooks but never styled - remove them if no CSS exists
  - Dark mode sections need explicit text color overrides for all text elements, including section-header__description
  - Always check if there's a dark mode override for muted text colors when section--dark is used
