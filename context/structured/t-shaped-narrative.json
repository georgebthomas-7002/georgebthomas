  "narrativeSummary": "George B. Thomas represents a rare breed of marketer: a T-shaped professional with not one but THREE deep expertise areas (HubSpot, Video, Podcasting) connected by broad marketing competencies. His 30+ year journey from high school dropout to industry thought leader exemplifies the transformation he now helps others achieve. Unlike specialists who know one thing deeply or generalists who know many things shallowly, George has achieved mastery in multiple verticals while maintaining breadth across the marketing discipline. This 'Y-Shape' converges at a single point: helping humans become the best versions of themselves through technology, content, and genuine connection."
