  "quote": "Working with George and his team at Sidekick Strategies has been amazing! He and his team are the first time in almost fifteen years that I've worked with a marketing professional and team where I actually feel like what we said we were going to do is getting done! They bring an energy and personality that is fun and easy to connect with. And they gently yet firmly guide my ideas to show me how to amplify the efforts and make it better. World class client service is found from these amazing human beings and I'm grateful to have them on my team!",
