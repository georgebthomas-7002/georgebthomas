  "quote": "Training can often mean a ho-hum session where the participants try to stay awake while the trainer trudges through the material. That's not the case if you're working with George. I promised my coworkers that he would deliver training as they'd never experienced before, and he over-delivered! He adapted the two-day course to our specific needs and made it relevant to everyone in the room, including those who hadn't worked with HubSpot before. George is a force of positive energy who makes learning entertaining. If you are considering a HubSpot Intensive Training session with George Thomas, book it! You will not regret your investment.",
