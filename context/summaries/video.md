## Video Marketing Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

> "Video is the easiest way to communicate on a human level in a digital world."

> "If you're not using video to grow your brand, you're already falling behind."

> "Humans don't buy from brands. They buy from other Humans."

### The Trust-Revenue Connection

George teaches that video creates a powerful chain reaction:

```
Relationship --> Trust --> Reciprocity --> Revenue
```

> "When you go to relationship, you go to trust. When you go to trust, you go to reciprocity. And when you go to reciprocity, that equals revenue."

### On Imperfection

> "I'm not paralyzed by perfection because I'm focused on publication."

> "Embrace the messy."

## Video Frameworks & Strategies

### 1. The "80% Videos" Framework

Quick, revenue-driven videos addressing the questions sales teams receive most frequently:
- 2-minute videos providing efficient education
- Replace lengthy email explanations
- Focus on the 80% of questions that come up repeatedly

### 2. Three Core Principles for Every Video

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Human** | Be authentic and natural, avoid personas |
| **Happy** | Start with a smile - positivity is infectious |
| **Helpful** | Educate rather than sell overtly |

### 3. The "Rockfest" Method

Bulk video creation approach:
- Quarterly production sessions
- Create **30-35 finished videos** in a day and a half
- More efficient than expensive multi-day shoots

### 4. Video Types Every Business Needs

1. **Email signature videos** (30 seconds to 1.5 minutes)
2. **Culture/mission/vision videos**
3. **Employee introductions**
4. **Customer testimonials/case studies**
5. **Educational content** (answering common questions)
6. **Live video** (Facebook Live, etc.)
7. **Product/service page videos**
8. **Personalized onboarding videos**

## Video Marketing Tips from George

### Overcoming Camera Anxiety
1. Recognize that helping others matters more than your appearance
2. Practice in low-stakes platforms (Instagram Live, Snapchat)
3. Study communication styles of speakers you admire
4. Embrace imperfection - publication beats perfection
5. Expect improvement after 5-10 videos

### The "Unscalable" Advantage

> "Where you find the magic moments where you actually make the most revenue is when you focus on the things that feel that are unscalable."

Personalized video creates differentiation precisely because competitors won't do it.

### Workshop Revenue Model for Agencies
- Sell communication training workshops ($3,500-$7,500)
- Pre-sell gear costs while improving client comfort on camera
- Create multiple revenue streams: workshop fees, production services, editing fees
