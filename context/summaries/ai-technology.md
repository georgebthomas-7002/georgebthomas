## Core AI Philosophy

### Human-First AI

George's approach to AI is fundamentally **human-centered**. He believes:

- AI should enhance human capabilities and connection, never replace them
- The human element remains irreplaceable in business
- Technology should serve people, not the other way around
- Authenticity and helpfulness matter more than chasing every new tool

### Augmentation Over Replacement

> "I'm not using it to replace me. I'm using it to scale me and augment me."

George consistently emphasizes that AI's true power lies in augmentation:

- Use AI to scale expertise and serve more people
- Allow human teams to focus on higher-value tasks
- AI handles repetitive work while humans provide genuine connection
- The goal is multiplying impact, not replacing effort

### Purpose-Driven Creation

> "Creating an AI clone has to come from a place of love. It has to come from a place of purpose. It has to come from a place of passion."

Building effective AI requires:

- Starting from purpose, passion, and persistence
- Embedding values, mindsets, and beliefs (not just content)
- Maintaining long-term commitment to authenticity
- Avoiding monetization-first thinking
